Revision history for Perl extension IOC.

0.24
    + Added IOC::Config::XML     
        - added tests and documentation for this
        - added XML::Simple as a dependency

    * IOC::Exceptions
        - added some expecptions for IOC::Config::XML
            ~ IOC::ConfigurationError
            

0.23 Fri Jan 14 2005
    * IOC::Registry
        - added aliasService() method so that you
          can alias one service path for another
            - added tests for this
            - added docs for this

0.22 Mon Dec 27 2004
    * IOC::Service::ConstructorInjection
    * IOC::Service::SetterInjection    
        - fixed class loading error in both, these
          services will load your class if it is not
          loaded already, and they were not doing
          it correctly. 
            - added tests to confirm fixes

0.21 Sat Dec 25 2004 (Merry Christmas)
    + Added IOC::Service::Literal
        - this is an optimization to allow for literal
          values to be held as services without them 
          needing to be wrapped in subroutines.
        - added documentation for this
        - added tests for this
        
    * IOC::Container
        - optmized this for IOC::Service::Literal objects
          since they cannot have dependencies, and therefore
          cannot have circular references there is no need to 
          fuss with them (lock, deferred, etc). 

0.20 Thurs Dec 23 2004
    * IOC::Service::ConstructorInjection
        - added support for getting constructor args
          which are outside of the current container
          and can be located with find()
            - added tests for this
            - added to the docs for this
            
    * IOC::Service::SetterInjection
        - added support for getting setter args
          which are outside of the current container
          and can be located with find()
            - added tests for this
            - added to the docs for this

0.19 Thurs Dec 23 2004
    * IOC::Proxy
        - fixed an issue with how overloaded
          objects were handled. We no longer 
          copy the '()' method. This will help
          to deal with overloaded object in
          a more consistent manner.

0.18 Fri Dec 17 2004
    * IOC::Container
        - improved some diagnostic messages
        
    * IOC::Visitor::ServiceLocator
        - improved some diagnostic messages
            - added tests for these

    * IOC::Exceptions
        ~ added IOC::UnableToLocateService to help improve
          the diagnostics in IOC::Visitor::ServiceLocator

0.17 Wed Dec 15 2004
    * IOC::Container
        - added code to make sure that proxied instances
          do not get re-proxied when they are retrieved
          with get() again. 
            - added tests for this

0.16 Fri Nov 26 2004
    * IOC::Service
        - added the deferred() method, which will
          return an IOC::Service::Deferred wrapper
          around the given service instance. 

    * IOC::Container
        - removed the direct reference to the 
          IOC::Service::Deferred class, and it
          now calls the deferred() method on 
          the IOC::Service instance itself.

0.15 Sat Nov 20 2004
    * IOC::Container
        - adjusted how cyclical dependencies are
          handled, so that they are now possible,
          although still somewhat in their early 
          stages.
            - added tests for this
        
    * IOC::Service
        - adjusted how cyclical dependencies are
          handled, and created a sub-package called
          IOC::Service::Deferred to facilitate this
            - added tests for this

0.14 Thurs Nov 18 2004
    > now using Scalar::Util::blessed() instead of 
      the convoluted UNIVERSAL::isa() stuff. This 
      change affects a number of packages.
      - added Scalar::Util as a dependency

0.13 Wed Nov 17 2004
    * IOC::Service::Prototype
        - removed any reference to the prototypical
          instance, so that complete lifecycle control
          is given to the consumer of the service
            ~ added tests and documentation for this

0.12 Tues Nov 16 2004
    + Added IOC::Proxy::Interfaces
        - added tests and documentation for this 
        
    * IOC::Proxy
        - broke out some more methods, so that subclasses
          can really affect things on a granular level

0.11 Thurs Nov 11 2004   
    * IOC
        - added the IOC::Proxy module to the module 
          which get pre-loaded with this module
        
    * IOC::Proxy
        - broke the main methods down into small methods
          (in Strategy pattern fashion) to allow for 
          variance of functionality in subclasses
           
    * IOC::Container
        - now detects a cyclical relationship and will
          throw an IOC::IllegalOperation exception if it
          is found. I am currently working on how to 
          allow for these types of relationships to exists
          so this is really just a temporary solution.

0.10 Tues Nov 9 2004
    * IOC::Proxy
        ~ fixed a warning about subroutine redefinition
          when we add the auto-stringification 
          functionality to an object

0.09 Mon Nov 8 2004
    + added IOC::Proxy
        - added tests and documentation for this 
    
    * IOC::Exceptions
        - added the IOC::OperationFailed exception
        
    * IOC::Container
        - added the proxy related functions and all
          the code to handle it
            ~ added tests and documentation 
              for this functionality

0.08 Fri Nov 5 2004
	* IOC::Container
        - added the 'unregister' method to remove 
          allow a IOC::Service to be removed
            ~ added tests and documentation
                      
    * IOC::Service
        - added the 'removeContainer' method to 
          facilitate the IOC::Container->unregister
          method
            ~ added tests and documentation

0.07 Thurs Oct 21 2004
    > Improved documentation for all classes, however
      I still have more to write

    + added IOC::Service::Prototype
    + added IOC::Service::Prototype::ConstructorInjection
    + added IOC::Service::Prototype::SetterInjection 
        - this allows services to dispense prototypes
          rather then just singleton instances
            ~ added tests for these new classes

    * IOC::Exceptions
        ~ added IOC::NotFound exception to handle
          general cases

    * IOC::Container
        ~ added findRootContainer method
          
    * IOC::Container::MethodResolution
        - now handles auto-finding of sub-containers
          as well, and introduces a new pseduo-method
          'root' which will allow you to go back to the
          root of the container hierarchy.

    * IOC::Service::ConstructorInjection
        - fixed parameter handling so it works
          with the Prototype:: classes 

    * IOC::Visitor::ServiceLocator
        - now uses findRootContainer method
        
    * IOC::Visitor::SearchForContainer
        - removed redundant code (thanks Devel::Cover :)

0.06 Tues Oct 19 2004
    << NOTE: Some API Changes >>

    * IOC::Registry
        - changed names of methods, anything with 
          the word 'Root' in it has now been changed
          to 'Registered'.

                ~ added documentation for all these
        > added 'find' method which utilizes a Visitor

            ~ IOC::DuplicateServiceException to IOC::ServiceAlreadyExists
