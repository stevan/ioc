=head1 NAME

IOC::Service::Prototype::ConstructorInjection - An IOC Service object which returns a prototype instance

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use IOC::Service::Prototype::ConstructorInjection;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class essentially can be used just like IOC::Service::ConsturctorInjection, the only difference is that it will return a new instance of the component each time rather than a singleton instance.
