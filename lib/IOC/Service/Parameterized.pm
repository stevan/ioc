=head1 NAME

IOC::Service::Parameterized - An IOC Service object which accepts a set of parameters for the instance

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is just like IOC::Service::Prototype, expect that it will accepts a set of key/value parameters 
to the C<instance> method. It is used to support IOC::Service::Parameterized.

=head1 CAVEAT

It does not make any sense to have ConstructorInjection or SetterInjection subclasses of this, so 
they will probably never get created (at least not by me). 

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item B<instance (%params)>

This method returns the literal value held by the service object based on the parameters.

=item B<setContainer ($c)>

This just makes sure that our service is always being added to IOC::Container::Parameterized 
container objects. Otherwise the parameterization wouldn't work.

=item B<deferred>

A parameterized service does not support being deferred.

=back

=head1 BUGS

None that I am aware of. Of course, if you find a bug, let me know, and I will be sure to fix it. 

=head1 CODE COVERAGE

I use B<Devel::Cover> to test the code coverage of my tests, see the CODE COVERAGE section of L<IOC> for more information.
