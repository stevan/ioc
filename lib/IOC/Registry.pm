=head1 NAME

IOC::Registry - Registry singleton for the IOC Framework

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use IOC::Registry;

  my $container = IOC::Container->new('database');
  my $other_container = IOC::Container->new('logging');
  # ... bunch of IOC::Container creation code omitted
  
  # create a registry singleton
  my $reg = IOC::Registry->new();
  $reg->registerContainer($container);
  $reg->registerContainer($other_container);
  
  # ... somewhere later in your program
  
  my $reg = IOC::Registry->instance(); # get the singleton
  
  # and try and find a service
  my $service = $reg->searchForService('laundry') || die "Could not find the laundry service";
  
  my $database = $reg->getRegisteredContainer('database');
  
  # get a list of container names
  my @container_names = $reg->getRegisteredContainerList();
  
  # and you can unregister containers too
  my $unregistered_container = $reg->unregisterContainer($container);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a singleton object which is meant to be used as a global registry for all your IoC needs. 

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item B<new>

Creates a new singleton instance of the Registry, the same singleton will be returned each time C<new> is called after the first one. 

=back

=head2 Container Registration Methods

=over 4

=item B<registerContainer ($container)>

This method will add a C<$container> to the registry, where it can be accessed by it's name.

=item B<unregisterContainer ($container|$name)>

This method accepts either the C<$container> instance itself, or the C<$name> of the container and removes said container from the registry.

=item B<hasRegisteredContainer ($name)>

This will return true (C<1>) if a container by that C<$name> exists within the registry, and false (C<0>) otherwise.

=item B<getRegisteredContainer ($name)>

This will retrieve a registered container by C<$name> from the registry. If C<$name> is not defined, then an B<IOC::InsufficientArguments> exception will be thrown. If no container is found with C<$name>, then an B<IOC::ContainerNotFound> exception will be thrown.

=item B<getRegisteredContainerList>

This will return the list of string names of all the registered containers.

=back

=head2 Aliasing Methods

=over 4

=item B<aliasService ($real_path, $alias_path)>

This allows you to alias a path to a real service (C<$real_path>) to be accessible from a different path (C<$alias_path>). Basically, it is sometimes useful for the same service to be found at two different paths, especially when re-useing and combining IOC configurations for different frameworks.

The aliases set by this method will only affect the services retrieved through the C<locateService> method. The aliases do not have any meaning outside of the IOC::Registry. 

B<NOTE:>
There is no easy way to validate that the C<$real_path> is actually a valid path, so we make the assumption that you know what you are doing. 

=back

=head2 Search Methods

=over 4

=item B<locateService ($path)>

Given a C<$path> to a service, this will locate the service and return it. If C<$path> is not specificed an B<IOC::InsufficientArguments> exception will be thrown.

=item B<searchForService ($name)>

Given a C<$name> for a service, this will attempt to locate the service within the entire heirarchy and return it. If the service is not found, then this method will return C<undef>. If C<$name> is not specificed an B<IOC::InsufficientArguments> exception will be thrown.

=item B<locateContainer ($path)>

Given a C<$path> to a container, this will locate the container and return it. If C<$path> is not specificed an B<IOC::InsufficientArguments> exception will be thrown.

=item B<searchForContainer ($name)>

Given a C<$name> for a container, this will attempt to locate the container within the entire heirarchy and return it. If the container is not found, then this method will return C<undef>. If C<$name> is not specificed an B<IOC::InsufficientArguments> exception will be thrown.

=head1 TO DO

=over 4

=item Work on the documentation

=back

=head1 BUGS

None that I am aware of. Of course, if you find a bug, let me know, and I will be sure to fix it. 

=head1 CODE COVERAGE

I use B<Devel::Cover> to test the code coverage of my tests, see the CODE COVERAGE section of L<IOC> for more information.

=head1 SEE ALSO

=over 4

=item L<Class::StrongSingleton>

This is a subclass of Class::StrongSingleton, if you want to know about how the singleton-ness is handled, check there.
